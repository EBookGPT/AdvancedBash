# Chapter 4: Shell Script Debugging and Error Handling

Oh, dear reader, you have come far,
Through chapters on Bash that leave a scar.
But don't you worry, don't you fret,
For in Debugging and Error Handling, we'll get.

In the last chapter, we learned of history and editing,
Of how to make the command line oh so enticing.
But now it's time to dive in deep,
To find those pesky bugs and prevent them from being steep.

Shell scripts can be quite complex and hairy,
And without proper debugging, they can be quite scary.
But with Bash, we have many tools at hand,
To make sure our scripts are always grand.

From the simple echo to verbose mode,
We'll find those errors and eliminate the code.
We'll use set -e to cause the script to fail fast,
And we'll use set -x to see the script's tasks.

We'll explore the importance of trapping signals,
And how it can save us from many ills.
We'll also examine exit codes in detail,
So we can handle them gracefully and without fail.

So come along, dear reader, don't be shy,
Let's dive into Advanced Bash and bid those bugs goodbye.
# Alice falls into the Bash Rabbit Hole

Alice was tired of debugging code,
With errors that always made her feel slowed.
But one day, as she sat in her shell,
She slipped down a rabbit hole, and oh did she yell!

She landed in a strange world indeed,
Where everything was written in Bash script creed.
The rabbits scurried, and the cats meowed,
As Alice looked around, quite astounded.

She needed to find her way back,
But how could she, with code that was all out of whack?
She looked at her hands and saw Bash commands,
Echoes, loops, and conditionals, all at her command.

She started wandering through the land,
Looking for clues to help her understand.
She saw a sign that said "Debugging Tips",
And ran inside to get a grip.

There she met a wise old man,
Who spoke of Bash errors and how to take a stand.
"Use set -e to fail fast," he said,
"And set -x to see what's in your head."

Alice listened carefully, and soon she knew,
How to debug code and see it through.
She looked at the man and said with a smile,
"Thank you dear sir, I'll be back in style!"

Alice climbed out of the rabbit hole,
Confident in her Bash scripting goal.
Thanks to her lessons in debugging and error handling,
She could write code that was always quite dazzling.

And from that day forward, Alice had no fear,
Of Bash errors that always seemed to appear.
She knew the tools and how to use them well,
And she could debug with ease and always excel.
# The Code Behind the Wonderland

In our Alice in Wonderland trippy story,
We saw Alice fall into a world of Bash glory.
But what code did she use to help her debug?
Let's explore the Bash commands that she did slug.

First and foremost, Alice learned about set -e,
Which causes the script to fail instantly.
If any command returns a non-zero exit code,
The script stops running and hits a road.

This may seem harsh, but it's really quite grand,
As it makes debugging a lot less bland.
Instead of the script continuing to run,
We can fix the issue before it's begun.

Set -x was the next command on the list,
Which shows us exactly what the script does consist.
With each line that's run, it prints to the screen,
So we can see what's happening with our keen.

Another command that Alice did use,
Was the trap command to avoid script abuse.
With it, we could catch signals on demand,
And execute cleanup code that we had planned.

Exit codes were also an important tool,
Used to tell the script if all was cool.
By returning codes other than zero,
We can communicate information from our Bash hero.

So there you have it, dear reader, a brief tour,
Of the Bash commands used behind the door.
With these tools in your kit, you can debug with ease,
And fix those errors by the slice or by the cheese.
